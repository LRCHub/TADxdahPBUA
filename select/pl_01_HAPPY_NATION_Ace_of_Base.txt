happy nation
living in a happy nation
where the people understand
and dream of the perfect man
a situation leading to
sweet salvation
for the people for the good
for mankind brotherhood
we're travelling in time
ideas by man
are only that will last
and over time
we've learned from the past
that no man's fit
to rule the world alone
a man will die but not his ideas
